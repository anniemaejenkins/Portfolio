      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Since I first picked up a controller to play games, I have always been interested
      in technology. I got into art at an early age and continue to pursue it as a fun hobby
      when I have downtime. When I discovered blogging on the web as a middle schooler, I became obsessed
      by code and how I could use it to change the way my layout and words would appear on
      my page. When I reached out to learn more, I was steered away from continuing and focused
      my time into art. When I saw the opportunity to give code another chance, I decided to
      try to see what all I could do and have enjoyed the challenges and successes at my time
      in The Iron Yard.</p>
